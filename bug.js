This error occurs when using the Expo Web module with React Navigation.  The error message might vary, but it generally indicates that React Navigation is trying to access a native module that isn't available in the web environment. This often manifests as a `TypeError` or other exceptions related to undefined methods or properties.  Specifically, components relying on native modules for features like screen transitions or animations might fail.  For instance, using a native-only animation library within a React Navigation component will cause this issue.  The code might look something like this, failing on web:

```javascript
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native'; // Problem line here

function MyScreen() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  // ...more code...
}
```
